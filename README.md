# Competition Details

The following details were published to SGF Web Devs slack.

## 2018/11/16 ([Myke Bates](https://github.com/mykebates))

Many of you have heard me talk about this. For those of you that haven’t, read the description below.

Tldr;
I am officially seeking 3 individuals to participate in the dev competition for the event on Dec. 5th. The task will be to execute the development of the new Web Devs single-page-ISH site. The goal is to have 4 devs competing and we currently have one. If you are front-end inclined and want to partake, let me know! It will be first come first serve.


Full description(a more official version will be provided Monday the 3rd);
The big event this year will be officially billed as a DevFest event in partnership with GDG Springfield. It will be an all day conference with the evening portion taking place during the usual Web Devs time slot. The evening event will be solely dedicated to the development competition, which is an idea that is completely stolen from the Springfield Creative’s Yule Duel. https://www.facebook.com/events/551401731869972/

Only we don’t have a cool name to go along with it yet :slightly_smiling_face:

The format will look like this.

4 developers take the stage to see who can best complete the task at hand. 45 minutes before the start time, the design will be presented to the group of developers and all of the details will be explained. The project, which will be a new website for the Web Devs group, will be small enough in nature to “finish” in 2 hours - which is exactly how much time will be given to complete.

No backend experience will be required for this competition, but if you choose to use backend tools, that is fine. There will be a judge panel that will critique the work and crown the winner. The winner will be awarded a trophy and their work will carry on to eventually replace the current Web Devs site.

The design work will be delivered via Invision & Sketch. If you do not have a Sketch license and or are unfamiliar with the application but want to use it, please be prepared to download a trial before the event and familiarize yourself with the basics. Sketch is NOT REQUIRED. An InVision project will be delivered to you as well. So you will need to have an account setup and provide me with your account’s email address. Signup is free.

This will be a spectator sport. You will have a large screen behind you showing your work in real time for the audience and judges to see. If we can properly figure it out, your screen will also be streamed live as well.

This is supposed to be a fun yet CHALLENGING experience. Expect some curveballs and be prepared to bring your a-game. The trophy is yours for the taking!

If you have questions, I will be happy to answer. NO specific details about the project will be provided. All questions and answers should be posted in #dev-competition-2018 for everyone to see, but if you do have a personal question please DM me.

Your details for Wednesday night:

The goal for the competition is to develop as fast and as best you can a design that was done by Brad Hill. The design is for the new SGF Web Devs website. It is a single page app structure consisting of a main landing page with modal-esque takeovers and altered main states depending on the time the user visits the site. This will become much more clear when the design is unveiled.

The design will be unveiled to the 4 of you privately with the judging panel at 5:00PM Wednesday. We will meet in the Eagle Speak office (1063) at the eFactory. You will have 45min to ask any questions you’d like about the design, intentions with the designs, functionality, etc.

You will be expected to start the competition with a blank slate. So if you want to do some katas after seeing the design, feel free, but you will not be allowed to bring any code to the competition that was written after seeing the design.

As far as rules go, just about anything is going to be allowed here. You can use any tools/frameworks/etc that you’d like. This will add to the fun by allowing the audience a glimpse into your preferred tools and workflows.

We will need to plug in an HDMI cable into your machine in order to send the video out to the 65 inch screen that will be behind you. At this point we’d prefer that you do not use a secondary monitor, but if you feel it is crucial to workflow, bring your monitor and we will see if it works well with the setup. So, we will try accommodate it, but be prepared for the chance that it doesn’t work with the setup. If you will require a dongle for the HDMI connection, please bring it. Let me know if you will not have one and we will work it out. Bring all the peripherals you’d like.

The design will be provided to you in a Sketch file. If you do not have the Sketch app and would rather not install a trial version of it, please register(if you do not have an account) with InVision https://www.invisionapp.com/ and let me know your email address so I can get you added to the project. Both Sketch and InVision will allow you to explore the document, export assets, inspect colors/fonts/dimensions/etc.
You will have 2.5 hours from 6:30-9:00 to complete your work. Take breaks as you need them, but seeking help is not permitted UNTIL the scheduled break at 7:30. At this time you will have a 15 minute(7:30-7:45) window to pull in help should you need or want it. After that you’ll be on your own for the rest of the time.

Promptly at 9:00 - you have your work committed and pushed to a public GitHub/Bitbucket repo and send the link to said repo to this Slack channel.

The judges will have already been keeping a close eye on your work but will use the repos to perform a final sweep of judgment across the work.

Judging will wrap up by 9:30 and the trophy will be awarded to the winner.

You will be judged on 3 things.

1 - Output quality: The site should look as close to the design mockup as possible. The site should be responsive and work well on screen sizes ranging from large monitors to a 320px wide mobile screen. - (70 Total Points)

2 - Code quality: This is somewhat subjective but I think we can all distinguish clean code from messy code. So be sure to keep things semantic, standards compliant, and clean. Articles like this come to mind https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/12-principles-for-keeping-your-code-clean/ (15 Total Points)

3 - Project architecture quality: Your work here will eventually become or be largely integrated into the actual SGF Web Devs website. So your choice in tooling, setup, compilation, etc will be taken into consideration for its feasibility in reuse. (15 Total Points)

If you had not seen. I did decide to drop a hint about the design and I will restate it now. If you come in Wednesday evening having a working knowledge of CSS Grid, this will go a long ways. A couple of nice resources

This event is intended to challenging but most of all, FUN. It is expected that the audience will see you struggle through your work. After all, this is what we do everyday. So don’t fret too much :heart:

Let me know if there are questions in the meantime, otherwise, see you all on Wednesday!

## 2018/12/04 ([Myke Bates](https://github.com/mykebates))

The question came up wondering if you can have a file/folder structure ready to work with. Example: a Boostrap, custom Sass setup, HorseStrap, etc. Yes this is entirely permitted. The goal is for you to use the toolchain you are used to in order to get rocking as fast as possible
